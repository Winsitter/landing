This is a list of free things you can use or do to improve your "security posture" as a human using the Internet in 2015. Most of these I've been recommending for over a decade for personal and business use. Big businesses may have lots of fancy systems to monitor and protect their information, but each human needs to do their part as well.

Some of these things are best practices, some are just "don't use the most popular

1 **Long Passwords rather then "Strong"**

Don't
2 **Never Use The Same Password Twice**
3 **Protect Your Browser**

* Don't use IE. It's getting better, but is still a huge target (and it's add-in's).
* Use WOT. It's a broswer add-in that will warn you with colored rings BEFORE you click on that web link that you shouldn't.

4 **Backup Your Data**
5 **Protect your DNS**
6 **Encrypt Your Computer**
7 **Scan For Insecure Software (Windows)**
8 **Enable "Wipe On Bad PIN's" on SmartPhone**
9 **Enable Two Factor Auth**
10 **Encrypt Your Wifi**
11 **Run Antivirus**
12 **Check For Updates Monthly**
13 **Don't Install Java or Acrobat**
