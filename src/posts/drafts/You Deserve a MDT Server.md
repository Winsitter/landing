If I walked you through setting up a Windows 7 network deployment service and you realized how easy it was (assuming you knew the right buttons to click in the right order) I bet 90% of you would make one tomorrow so you could deploy (and image) at will.

Here's some references I've found helpful to get started. Note that if you adhere to KISS on this one, you're scope won't spiral out of control and consume your week. Most admins I help setup MDT want to automate everything and spend 90% of the time on the last 10% of tasks.

If you just start with a stock Windows 7 .wim then that's a huge step forward from DVD installs (or worse, using the install from the OEM). Then you can start slowly with things like Adding Microsoft Office and the other heavy hitters.
