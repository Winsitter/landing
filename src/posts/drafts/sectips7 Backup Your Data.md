Summary: It's now easier then ever to *automatically* backup your PC, Mac, tablet and phone to the cloud for a few dollars a month, so why aren't you doing it?


Sometimes even the best security can't protect you from yourself, a fire, or accidentally erasing data. That's why a regular backup is key to security, because it's insurance.

There are *many* only backup companies, and I recommend online, because they are automatic and seamless, and most importantly are not in your house, which can fail due to fire, disasters, or theft.

One's I have used and can recommend:
Carbonite
Backblaze
Arc (Mac)
