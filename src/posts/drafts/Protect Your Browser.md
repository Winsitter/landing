* Don't use IE. It's getting better, but is still a huge target (and its add-in's). Chrome and Firefox are great. Safari is fine too.
* Use WOT add-on. I rarely recommend browser extentions/add-on's, but WOT works to save us from clicking on links that may take us to unsafe sites. It's a broswer add-in that will warn you with colored rings BEFORE you click on that web link that you shouldn't.

Summary: Use [WOT "Web of Trust"](https://www.mywot.com/) add-on for browsers to give you stoplight colors for links. If you see red, DON'T click that link!
