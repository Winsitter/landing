*This is part of our **[9 Internet Security Tips for Humans](/2015/01/26/9-internet-security-tips-for-humans/)** series.*


> Summary: Use [WOT "Web of Trust"](https://www.mywot.com/) and/or anti-virus add-ons for browsers to give you stoplight colors for links. If you see red, DON'T click that link!

It's actually rare for bad software to get on your computer *without you doing something first*. Yes, I'm calling out all those people that tell me *"I don't know how it got on there, I didn't do anything!"*

**The fact is we usually either:**

1. Go to a website we shouldn't have, that uses a vulnerability in your browser to download and run something without your permission, or
2. We downloaded something *and executed it ourselves* that we shouldn't have.

Anti-virus (and good sense) is what will protect you from #2, but how to we help prevent #1?

### Browser Choice

Don't use IE unless it's the latest version (11 as of early 2015). It's getting better, but is still a huge target (and its add-in's). Chrome and Firefox are great. Safari is good too. Most of the issues with IE are related to it not always being up to date. This is true for all browsers, it's just that Chrome/Firefox are constantly updating themselves.

### WOT

Use the [*"Web of Trust"* add-on](https://www.mywot.com/). I rarely recommend browser extentions/add-on's, but WOT works to save us from clicking on links that may take us to unsafe sites. It's a browser add-in that will warn you with colored rings BEFORE you click on that web link that you shouldn't.

### Anti-virus Plug-in's

Use an anti-virus with a browser add-in that filters sites. Most now do this by default.

### DNS as Fail Safe

Follow [tip #3](/2015/02/09/how-to-protect-your-web-browsing) and use [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/opendns-ip-addresses/), which will help prevent you from web surfing to a bad site as well. The good thing about WOT and anti-virus browser add-in's is they give you a waring/rating *before* you try to go to the nefarious site.

### Update, update, update
Tip #4 will ensure you have the most up-to-date browser and add-in's, which will greatly lessen the risk of #1 above happening to you
