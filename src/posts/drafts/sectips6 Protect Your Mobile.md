>Summary: Run anti-malware on your phone (if you can). Ensure if you loose your phone, you make it hard for them to get your data: Set a pin with 5min or less timeout. Set your phone to wipe if they guess your pin to many times wrong. Setup your phone backup. Enable remote wipe, and ensure you know how to actually go about it.

Phones are the new target. Scratch that, they’ve been *the* target for a while now. Pins and auto-locking should be required in all cases. Here’s a quick list of things to ensure you’re doing, in order of priority:

Some tell me “but I don’t have lots of apps on my phone”, and then I ask about email. 99% say yes it’s on there. I shake my head. Access to your inbox is all anyone needs to reset the password on most online accounts. All the more reason to enable 2-factor authenction on accounts, as that makes password resets/access harder.

* Pin-lock your phone within 5 minutes (or less).
* Setup backups. Get your data back if phone is lost.
  * iPhone
  * Android
* Enable your phone to be errased on 10 failed pin attempts. Sleep better.
