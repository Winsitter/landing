Summary: Automatic Windows Updates aren't enough anymore. You've likely got popups from all sorts of apps asking to update on a weekly or daily basis. Mark 30 minutes on your calendar every month to go through your major programs and check for updates.

Summary: [Secunia PSI](http://secunia.com/products/consumer/) is fantastic free (for personal use) software for finding all the insecure software on your PC.

The most common way for you to "get hacked" is to use the Intenret with *vunerable* software with known security issues. But how do you know what software is vunerable?

On Windows you run Secunia's free (for personal use) PSI. This scanner operates a bit like antivirus on each PC, always checking to be sure all the software installed on your computer has the most current security updates and doesn't have well known security holes in them. It will warn you when it finds something, and in many cases will install the update for you.

Windows Update is great, but only covers Microsoft software. PSI handles the rest.

I know nothing like this on Mac.

### Alternative to Secunia
An alternative to using Secunia, you can protect against the worst of the worst by uninstallin the [most common insecure software](http://www.av-test.org/en/news/news-single-view/adobe-java-make-windows-insecure/?=):

If you use Google Chrome, it blocks [most of this list by default](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1247383?hl=en).

#### Java
By far the most insecure software on the planet. Most people don't know if they need it, so I recommend uninstalling it, and if all your programs work, great. If not, just [reinstall it](https://java.com/download). If you must have it on your computer, ensure you update every time you see a pop-up to do so.

#### Acrobat
I recommend avoiding Acrobat and using [Nitro Reader](https://www.gonitro.com/pdf-reader). I think it's better in all respects. If you *must* have Adobe Acrobat, always update when it reminds you to, [which is at least monthly](http://helpx.adobe.com/security.html#acrobat).

#### IE
Internet Explorer is only as secure as you keep it updated. You want to ensure Windows Updates run monthly (see #4 above). You should run the latest version (11 as of Jan 2015).

#### Flash
Flash: Although better in recently releases, this used to be a requirement for the modern web, but many sites including Youtube and Netflix no longer require it. I recommend uninstalling it from your PC/Mac, and when you *need* it, use Google Chrome, which comes with it's own always-up-to-date version of Flash.
