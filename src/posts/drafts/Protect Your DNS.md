*This is part of our **[13 Internet Security Tips for Humans](/2015/01/26/13-internet-security-tips-for-humans/)** series.*

>Summary: Use [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/opendns-ip-addresses/) as your DNS Servers on home routers and at work (if possible). It is easy to do, has no downside, and will protect you from known malicious websites that intend to do your browser and computer harm (or scam you of your personal info). Do it today!

----------------

I'm sure you've heard of a Website Filter or Proxy Server. Something parents use to keep their kids safe, and businesses use to keep employees from eating all the bandwidth. They used to be complicated, buggy, and expensive.

Now all that has changed, and there's virtually NO reason you shouldn't use this technique everywhere. Now rather then adding proxy software to computers, you just need a DNS filter that operates at the OS level of each computer or preferably, on your home/work router. No software required (although in some cases it can add features for larger businesses).

[OpenDNS.com](https://www.opendns.com) is the champion of this newer type of protection, serving [70 billion requests a *day*](http://system.opendns.com/). Nearly 3% of the world's computers use them, and it's growing. It's free for personal use and has low cost plans for business (per person, per year).

Give them a shot and let me know how it goes.
