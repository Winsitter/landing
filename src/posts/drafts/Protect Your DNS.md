Summary: Use [Dyn Internet Guide](http://dyn.com/labs/dyn-internet-guide/) or [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/opendns-ip-addresses/) as your DNS Servers on home routers and at work if possible. It will protect you from known malicious websites that intend to do your browser and computer harm (or scam you of your personal info).
