When you have an idea for a software product, it's all unicorns and rainbows at first.  Eventually (months) later you realize it's WAY more work then you expected just to get to v1.  Sometimes people give up at this point, or put stuff off to the point it stagnates and dies a slow death before ever seeing the light.

Going beta early is a cure for that.  No one likes working on something that doesn't mater.  Bringing in your first few customers gives you that boost you may need in the Early Days.

The challenge for us has been that beta releases of web services and apps today are usually quite good, and many are release quality, which makes it tough to decide when to open the beta.
