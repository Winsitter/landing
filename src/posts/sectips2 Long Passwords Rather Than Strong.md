*This is part of our **[9 Internet Security Tips for Humans](/2015/01/26/9-internet-security-tips-for-humans/)** series. If this is your first time here, read those articles first.*

>Summary: Make your passwords longer and easier for you remember (or use a Password Manager) rather then random 8 characters. When it comes to computers guessing your password, they assume it's short. 13+ characters is great. Use words. Repeat things. But really, this is a backup plan to [Tip #1](/2015/01/27/never-use-the-same-password-twice/).

-------------

[This famous comic](http://xkcd.com/936/) sums it up exactly. On the Internet, a complex 8 character password will always be weak, and a 15 character password, even with repeating characters, is much better.

>Remember from [Tip #1](/2015/01/27/never-use-the-same-password-twice/), even a 25-character password that's random won't protect you from certain types of password theft, like in the case of LinkedIn's lossed passwords that were laid bare online. That's why this tatic alone isn't enough, but needs to be combined with the Password Manager and unique passwords per-site.

But if I had to choose between a longer password or a more complex and random one, I'd choose length every time. See Steve Gibson's [Password Haystack](https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm) to test various passwords. He takes on the assumtions, as I do, that someone trying to rapidly guess your password knows nothing about it. They don't know *IF* you used a complex password, or how long it is. So after they go through the most commonly used passwords, they have to start guessing, one character at a time. They will start with the shortest password allowed and work their way up. That means, yours should be as long as you can handle it.

Also, this may seem obvious, but don't use anything on the [worst passwords list](http://www.cnet.com/news/worst-passwords-of-2014-are-just-as-awful-as-you-can-imagine/), or any datapoint about you specifically, your birth date, name, etc.

If you don't/can't use [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) to generate your passwords, GRC has a [great autogenerator](https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm) for long random passwords. These are obviously not ment for memorizing. You'd have to store them somewhere.  

You *could* use the GRC password generator in combination with your browsers built-in password storage. Not as good as LastPass, but better then nothing.

Note: there is much debate about the strength of passwords in terms of random vs. non-random, or letters vs. words, or time it takes to crack one vs. other with various techniques. This isn't about that. This is about upping your password game, and making it harder (not impossible) for someone to guess them. Don't throw out the good in search of the perfect.
