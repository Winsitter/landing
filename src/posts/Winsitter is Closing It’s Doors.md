Hello loyal customers,

It’s with great sadness that we’re writing to inform you that we’ll be ending our service this month. We’ve helped hundreds of people monitor their servers over the last three years, but have been unable to gain enough customer interest to get the company profitable.

We are so glad you chose to trust us with monitoring your servers.  On August 31st, 2015, we will shut down the Winsitter service.  You can continue using Winsitter until that day.  

**What steps do you need to take?**  
We recommend uninstalling the Winsitter service from your machines.
If you’d like to terminate your service earlier, please go to the Dashboard, select Subscriptions, and then Cancel Subscription.  If you choose to not do this, we will automatically cancel your subscription for you on the 31st. You’ll be refunded your unused subscription.

**What happens to my personal/machine data?**  
After the Winsitter server goes down, we will take action to promptly delete all customer and machine data we had access too.  Winsitter was not in the business of storing more than information about your system performance or services running.  Most data that did not generate an alert was simply thrown away.

Credit card data was stored with our provider, Stripe.com, and never touched one of our servers. They remove your card after your subscription is canceled.

**What’s next for the Winsitter team?**  
Some startups work, some don’t.  The great thing about building a startup like Winsitter is that we have learned a bajillion lessons about this industry.  If you’re interested in seeing what we’re up to, follow us on Twitter or LinkedIn.
