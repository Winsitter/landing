*This is part of our **[9 Internet Security Tips for Humans](/2015/01/26/9-internet-security-tips-for-humans/)** series.*

>Summary: To limit the damage of password theft, you need a different password for each website/app. Use a Password Manager ([LassPass](https://lastpass.com) recommended) to create and store unique passwords for each account.

---------------

We all started using the same passwords because we had to remember them. What, you can't remember 500 passwords? (we'll there's [that guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Farrow)). Maybe you got advanced and started making "layers" of passwords where you had a hard one for banking, another kinda-hard one for work, and an easy one for the rest. Layers, like an onion.

*That was good in 2005.*

But now it's not a matter of *if* your password gets stollen, it's just *when*. In fact it's very likely that multiple passwords of yours *have* been stolen. ([check here](https://pwnedlist.com/query)) In the last few years passwords were snagged from LinkedIn, Last.fm, Gmail, eHarmony and Adobe, just to name a few.

So what happens when your next password gets stollen and *maybe* you're notified to change it, but you used it EVERYWHERE, on dozen's or hundreds of sites... you likely don't remember all the places...

Answer is, you likely don't change it, and I don't blame you. That work sucks. You need to have a system where if one site is hacked, NO other account of yours is affected.

That means you can never reuse a password.

You could create a memory-based system described by [AVG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6cHKgbaHrQ), but that system is imperfect and doesn't work on every site/app. It's still better then the same-password-everywhere.

### Use a Password Manager

Until we achieve the [password-less future](http://www.wired.com/2013/01/google-password/all/) we want, the best thing we have is a program that:
* stores all your passwords
* makes up new ones for each site
* enters them for you
* tells you which passwords suck
* and protects them with one master password you *must* remember

These tools include [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword), [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/), and [more](http://www.asecurelife.com/dashlane-vs-lastpass-vs-1password-vs-roboform-vs-keepass/). I recommend [LastPass](https://lastpass.com), having used it for years, and trust the infamous [Steve Gibson's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Q_anb7pwg) approval of it.

You can try [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) for free. Don't try to do everything at once. First, just install it in your browsers and let it sit there until you need to log into something. It'll ask to save the login information. Do this everywhere. This is the first power of LastPass. Remembering all your accounts.

Eventually you'll need to change a password or create a new account. Then let LassPass create you a random long password. The first few times I was a bit nervous as I started "letting go" of managing passwords in my head.

And LastPass keeps adding great features. They'll give you an assessment of how secure you are based on the reuse and strength of all the passwords you stored in it. The mobile apps also help you signin automatically.  There's lots to explore, but **the key is to end up with every password changed so that all sites are unique.**

Let me know how it goes, or any questions you might have in the comments or at [@BretFisher](https://twitter.com/bretfisher). Do you like something other then LastPass?
