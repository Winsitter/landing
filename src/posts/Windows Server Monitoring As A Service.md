Why isn't everyone monitoring their servers, the important apps that run on them, and receiving mobile alerts when something needs attention?

We think it's because until now, server monitoring was still too time consuming to setup and required too much attention from admins.

Winsitter is designed to do all the monitoring work in the background and let you get back to more interesting projects. Our Tiny Agents sit on your servers (after a quick and easy install) and talk to our analysis engine in the cloud. If we see anything that could affect your server and services health we'll let you know. No dedicated monitoring server for you to mess with, nothing to upgrade, no monitoring console you have to log into every day.

And that's where the fun begins. We can tell you via email, text, Twitter, or even have a robot call you. You can tell Winsitter to email you for warnings but text and tweet for errors. Winsitter also doesn't bug you just because you got a "red x" in Event Logs. We've built a smart engine that goes after specific issues we know to be common to Windows Servers, including availability, configuration, security, and performance metrics.

We hope you like it. We're still in beta, so <a href="http://launch.winsitter.com">get on the invite list</a>.
