Hello everyone!

My name is Kevin Griffin, and I'm the CTO of Winsitter and lead developer on the project.  We are coming down to the wire of main development of the project, and we're fine tuning the product to be ready for launch.  My goal is to give you all a weekly update on the progress that's been made, and what our plans are for the future.

With a product like Winsitter, it's been important to rapidly develop and test features to see if they work.  A major side affect of this practice has been a build up of technical debt.  If you're not familiar with the term, I mean that we're cleaning up the processes we use to be more abstracted and better performing.

As we come closer to the launch of Winsitter, you should see dramatic speed increases on the website and on the agent.  There is also a lot of behind the scenes stuff you'll never notice, but it'll be easier for us to extend quickly and make the product better.

Do you have a particular question about Winsitter you'd like to see answered here?  Let me know!
