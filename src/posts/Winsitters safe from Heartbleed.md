You may have heard about the Heartbleed vulnerability with OpenSSL this week. Here's info about the status of our services and your accounts and data.

None of Winsitter's services were/are vulnerable to the Heartbleed issue. We run our services on a version of Node.js (which runs our web services) that doesn't enable the "heartbeat" SSL feature that was vulnerable to attack.

Even though Heartbleed was never an issue for us, we took this week to update all our services to the latest updates including OpenSSL.

Thanks for trusting us to monitor your servers. We know how important computer security is to you, and we consider the security of our service to be of the utmost importance.
