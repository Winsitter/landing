Today we're announcing the release of our new platform. Lets just call it Beta 2.0. If feels similar to the old, but under the covers it's almost all new. It's a year in the making. Everything is easier to use and better at monitoring your most common Windows Server issues.

<h2>Things of Note</h2>

<ul>
<li>New account required</li>
<li>Dashboard auto refreshes data in the background. always up to date</li>
<li>Easier ways to deploy agent (silent install for new installs)</li>
<li>Agents auto update</li>
<li>More things monitored (list is in the dashboard)</li>
<li>Alert multiple emails and phones</li>
<li>Dashboard performance improvement via browser caching of data thanks to <a href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor.js</a></li>
<li>Account security improvements. We actually hash and encrypt your password in-browser, so your password is never seen by our servers, thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SPA</a>.</li>
</ul>
