*This is part of our **[9 Internet Security Tips for Humans](/2015/01/26/9-internet-security-tips-for-humans/)** series. If this is your first time here, read those articles first.*


> Summary: Use anti-virus add-ons for browsers to give you stoplight colors for links and will scan pages and downloads. If you see red, DON'T click that link! Maybe also use [WOT "Web of Trust"](https://www.mywot.com/) to help learn if the site is considered "trustworty" by others.

It's actually rare for bad software to get on your computer *without you doing something first*. Yes, I'm calling out all those people that tell me *"I don't know how it got on there, I didn't do anything!"*

**The fact is we usually either:**

1. Go to a website we shouldn't have, that uses a vulnerability in our browser to download and run something without our permission, or
2. We downloaded something *and executed it ourselves* that we shouldn't have.

Anti-virus (and good sense) is what will protect you from #2, but how to we help prevent #1?

### Follow Previous Tips

[Tip 3 for using OpenDNS](/2015/02/09/how-to-protect-your-web-browsing/) will help save you *before* you browse to bad sites, [Tip 4 for using Secunia](/2015/02/16/how-to-scan-your-computer-for-insecure-software/) will help you know if your browser is out of date. **Do these steps first**.

### Browser Choice

Don't use Internet Explorer (IE) unless it's the latest version (11 as of early 2015). It's getting better, but is still a huge target (and its add-in's). Chrome and Firefox are great. Safari is good too. Most of the issues with IE are related to it not always being up to date, and not the latest version. This is true for all browsers, it's just that Chrome/Firefox are constantly updating themselves.

### Anti-virus Plug-in's

Use an anti-virus with a browser add-in that filters sites. Most now do this by default, but check yours to be sure.

### WOT

Use the [*"Web of Trust"* add-on](https://www.mywot.com/). I rarely recommend browser extentions/add-on's, but WOT works by asking real humans if the link you're about to click is trustworthy. This goes beyond malware and helps us ensure the place we're about to visit can be trusted to say/do what it claims. Note that it's not fool-proof, so it should *not* be your only line of defense.
