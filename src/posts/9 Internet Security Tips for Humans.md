How can you be "safe and secure", while still using the Internet all day, and not look like you're planning for dooms day?

This list is about things you can use or do to improve your "security posture" as a human using the Internet in 2015 and beyond. Protect your accounts, protect your identity, protect your data. Most of these I've been recommending for over a decade.

Many are easy. Some are hard. All are worth it. Ordered in priority of benefit to you, rather then degree of difficulty.

More information about each recommendation will be added as additional postings in the coming weeks.

## 1. Never Use The Same Password Twice
To limit the damage of password theft, you need a different password for each website/app. Use a Password Manager ([LassPass](https://lastpass.com) recommended) to create and store unique passwords for each account.

## 2. Long Passwords Rather Than "Strong"
Make your passwords longer and easier for you remember (or use a Password Manager) rather then random 8 characters. When it comes to computers guessing your password, they assume it's short. 13+ characters is great. Use words. Repeat things. But really, this is a backup plan to [Tip #1](/2015/01/27/never-use-the-same-password-twice/).

## 3. Protect your DNS

>Summary: Use [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/opendns-ip-addresses/) as your DNS Servers on home routers and at work (if possible). It is easy to do, has no downside or extra lag, and will protect you from known malicious websites that intend to do your browser and computer harm (or scam you of your personal info). Do it today!

Know of something I missed (other then Antivirus, which I still recommend)? Comment below or tweet me [@BretFisher](https://twitter.com/bretfisher).

These guidelines are a balance (compromise) between "ultimate security" and "actually using it". Yes, not using the Internet is more secure. Yes, storing passwords in redundant physical vaults in paper form is *theoritcally safer*, but neither is *best* if no one does it. My goal here is to get you to actually *implement* these changes in your life, not give you the penultimate protection against all possible outcomes. Also, I'm not that smart.
