How can you be "safe and secure", while still using the Internet all day, and not look like you're planning for dooms day?

This list is about things you can use or do to improve your "security posture" as a human using the Internet in 2015 and beyond. Protect your accounts, protect your identity, protect your data. Most of these I've been recommending for over a decade.

Many are easy. Some are hard. All are worth it. Ordered in priority of benefit to you, rather then degree of difficulty.

More information about each recommendation will be added as additional postings in the coming weeks.

## 1. Never Use The Same Password Twice
Summary: To limit the damage of password theft, you need a different password for each website/app. Use a Password Manager ([LassPass](https://lastpass.com) recommended) to create and store unique passwords for each account.

Know of something I missed (other then Antivirus, which I still recommend)? Comment below or tweet me [@BretFisher](https://twitter.com/bretfisher).

These guidelines are a balance (compromise) between "ultimate security" and "actually using it". Yes, not using the Internet is more secure. Yes, storing passwords in redundant physical vaults in paper form is *theoritcally safer*, but neither is *best* if no one does it. My goal here is to get you to actually *implement* these changes in your life, not give you the penultimate protection against all possible outcomes. Also, I'm not that smart.
