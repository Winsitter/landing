<h2><strong>We love Windows. </strong>But let's face it, it's still difficult for busy admins to get notified of common every-day server issues. We believe businesses deserve to know of issues with their business systems before their users do!</h2>
&nbsp;
<h2>We created Winsitter in a way that removes complexity and hides the "geekery" of graphs and stats so anyone can signup, install the agent, and sleep better knowing they'll be notified of issues before users notify them.</h2>
&nbsp;
<h2>Issues like failed Windows services, low disc space, and expired SSL certificates are just a few of the complications that can plague admins and cause their phones to ring at the most inconvenient times. It's complicated, though, for many IT shops to implement comprehensive server monitoring.</h2>
&nbsp;
<h2>Our Dashboard is as much about what ISN'T as what IS. Our Dashboard is designed to be a place with actionable and useful information for the seasoned admin, as well as the up-and-coming server admin or the "I'm-not-a-server-person-but-people-call-me-when-it's-broke" admin.</h2>
&nbsp;
<h2>So we hope you like it.  Get all the <a title="Windows Server Monitoring as a Service" href="http://winsitter.com/windows-server-monitoring/">details over here</a>, and sign-up at any time at the top of the page.  Please leave some feedback, good or bad.  We're building this for ourselves and for you, so we love to hear ideas on how we can help you.</h2>
