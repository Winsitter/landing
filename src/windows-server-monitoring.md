<h2>Winsitter is a web app subscription which lets you monitor your Windows servers and receive alerts when something isn't right. We believe <strong>all</strong> businesses should monitor their servers, not just the big ones with a team of monitoring guru's. Winsitter only takes 5 minutes to signup and start monitoring your first server. It provides alert notifications via email or text. The web-based Dashboard gives you a live look at your server's status.</h2>

<h2><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Guiding Principles of Winsitter</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
<h2><strong>Rule #1:</strong> Fight "Alert Fatigue" at Every Opportunity. If an admin has too many warnings or alerts in their inbox, it's more likely to be ignored because of all the work to clean up warnings. Boo. Monitoring should reduce work, not add it.</h2>
</li>
	<li>
<h2><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Resist User Complexity. The simpler the solution is for admins, the more likely they will adopt it and keep using it. Making the complex look simple is hard, and that's what we do.</h2>
</li>
	<li>
<h2><strong>Rule #3:</strong> Inclusion Only.  We Op-Out by Default to System Event Log Warnings and Errors.  All software is imperfect.  Today, errors and warnings are almost normal in Windows Event Logs, and it's challenging to determine which Event Log message is truly actionable. We're following the 80/20 rule (20% of Event ID's make 80% of the noise), so we want to capture only the ones we feel are truly important and likely to impact your customers.</h2>
